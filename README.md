# MinemanNeuralNetwork

Designed and created a platformer game in Unity where the primary objective was to mine diamonds in a Minecraft-like world. This was done through a neural network and a genetic algorithm model to train the AI into learning the game through evolution in over 300 generations, where each generation had 20 models, the top 2 of which were chosen to reproduce and cross over DNA into the new generation
